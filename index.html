<span class="hidden-at-start"><span>Even though Adolf Loos has already received way too much attention, I am also choosing to engage with him. This decision to give a platform to a man with questionable beliefs and actions is a complex one, however, as a feminist, it is important to examine and critique these figures as part of living in proximity to a nerve, as discussed by Sara Ahmed in her book Living a Feminist Life.
</span></span>
<span class="hidden-at-start"><span>It is noteworthy to mention Beatriz Colomina's text <span class="italic">Battle Lines</span>, in which she tells us a story of Le Corbusier employing the technique of mural-painting as a means of ornamenting and yet defacing the surface, specifically the house made by Eileen Gray. Through this act, he asserts his ownership of the space, marking it with a bold and destructive gesture.
</span></span>
<span class="hidden-at-start"><span>Alice Twemlow mentions in her text <span class="italic">The decriminalization of Ornament</span> that <span class="italic"> even today, despite its proliferation and the slow emergence of discourse surrounding it, the use of decoration is still regarded by mainstream graphic design as a taboo—a testimony, perhaps, to modernism’s enduring hegemony.

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span><span class="italic">How can we bear the present?</span>asks Lisa Robertson in her book Anemones—A Simone Weil Project, thinking near Weil herself. At one point, she focuses on how reinhabiting the words that were misused or co–opted by the terrorizing powers can be an experience deeply valuable for resisting the flattening narratives. Simone Weil lived amid horror. In the 1940s she wrote: <span class="italic">The sole strength in the world is purity.</span> (<span class="italic">Petrement,</span> Simone Weil, p.16) Robertson chooses to give space for contemplation of Weil’s usage of the term. Weil, herself was Jewish and antifascist, and her choice to give great importance and value in her writings to the term purity (a theft enacted by Nazi propaganda of the time) can seem misplaced or troubling. But Robertson convinces us that it is a difficult relationship that unfolds multitudes that we should aim at. It underlines the relationship to language as contextual, including the histories of abuse, and heresy of resistance. It is a purity that is considered as opposition to force, purity is the opposite of force. <span class="italic"> Here the word purity pertains not to an essence or a putative origin, nor a coalitional focus or exclusivity, but to a quality of social relationship</span>—social mutual consent. It is a heresy because not many will take the time to understand the purpose of this employment. But this approach faces us with something exciting for me. It stands in opposition to neglect or erasure, it claims the reality in its fullness, offering this linguistic reinhabitation as a difficult fight against singularity and binaries. <span class="italic">It opens our ways of coexisting, and so our mentalities, if not always to hope, at least to a discernment that evades the market-driven flattening and squandering and of our intellectual and spiritual beings. Such discernment must underpin any lovingly committed living in the world, where the world is the inconceivable, irritating, stimulating many-ness that will persist nonetheless to the end, whether personal or global.</span>

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span><span class="italic">When we recover a potential from materials, when we refuse to use things properly, we are often understood not only as causing damage but as intending what we cause. Queer use could thus also be interpreted as vandalism: “the wilful destruction of the venerable and beautiful.”</span> Sara Ahmed for <span class="italic">feminstkilljoys</span> blog
</span></span>

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span><span class="italic">Consider how feminist artists have made use of complaint, or how feminist art can be complaint. The Guerrilla Girls, for instance, had an exhibition called Complaints Department, in which individuals and organizations were invited to post “about art, culture, politics, the environment, or any other issue they care about.” They also ran office hours where you could share your complaints “face to face.” You can turn what might be assumed to be a mundane administrative practice into an art project. The direction of travel goes both ways. Those who make complaints, who enter that department, the Complaint Department (though of course making formal complaints often means entering many departments), can turn what they do—it might seem tedious, it might seem dull, all those papers—into art. Or perhaps there is no turning involved; perhaps there is an art in the mundane, to the mundane.

On the other hand, the exigencies of capitalist profit-making may lead to this factor of production being excreted (as a form of waste) into unemployment or underemployment, creating surplus populations that are separated partially or fully from domains of capitalist exchange and social life. </span>

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span>Degrowth directs itself at reaching a society that <span class="italic">enables global ecological justice, strengthens social justice and self-determination and strives for a good life for all under the conditions of this changed metabolism. It redesigns its institutions and infrastructure so that they are not dependent on growth and continuous expansion for their functioning. </span>Multiple viewpoints exist on reaching this state, with no one perspective dominating the discourse. It is a pluriverse, containing many possible futures. This is reflected in number of degrowth-oriented imaginaries including currents that are institution-focused, sufficiency-focused, communing-focused (alternative economy), feminist, and post-capitalist/critical of globalization.

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span><span class="italic">Important factor in the devaluation of women’s labour was the campaign that craft workers mounted, starting in the late 15th century, to exclude female workers from their workshops, presumably to protect themselves from the assault of the capitalist merchants who were employing women at cheaper rates. The craftsmen’s efforts have left an abundant trail of evidence…
the discrimination that women have suffered in the waged work-force has been directly rooted in their function as unpaid laborers in the home.</span>

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span>Alongside these movements, new forms of surveillance were adopted in Europe to ensure that pregnant women did not terminate their pregnancies. Women were required to register every pregnancy and were sentenced to death if their infants died after a concealed delivery. Statutes were passed to surveil unwed mothers, and even unmarried pregnant women “became” illegal. A new medical practice prevailed that prioritized the life of the foetus over that of the mother which led to women being prosecuted in large numbers and later executed for infanticide. Midwives were marginalized, and male doctors came to be seen as the true "givers of life.".

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span>Ursula LeGuin paints a similar story in a conversation she had with Jonathan White (<span class="italic">Talking on the Water: Conversations about Nature and Creativity</span>) In it, she said:<span class="italic"> The daily routine of most adults is so heavy and artificial that we are closed off to much of the world. We have to do this in order to get our work done. I think one purpose of art is to get us out of those routines. When we hear music or poetry or stories, the world opens up again. We’re drawn in — or out — and the windows of our perception are cleansed, as William Blake said. The same thing can happen when we’re around young children or adults who have unlearned those habits of shutting the world out.</span>

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span><span class="italic">The ornament can be equated with expression also because it acts as a particular type of sign, whose original content fades almost completely in the favour of the meaning it has to embody or to enhance in a particular context. Its content being reduced or inessential, the ornamental sign acts as pure expression, although its form cannot be devoid of its primal sense and is chosen precisely for its signifying potential.

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span>a shadow, impression, and abstraction of conventional writing (Jacobson, Michael, Schwenger, Peter. <span class="italic">Asemic: The Art of Writing.</span> 2019)
These shapes have been designed and crafted to be used as a computer font with the specific purpose of enabling the practice of data divination, meditation, and investigations of the unconscious. This is a tool for detaching our cognitive system from the relationship between language and object, and from the relationship that connects a sound to a specific meaning. A tool for detaching us from our anthropocentric vision of realities. It’s also an attempt to sabotage our common language and—along with it—the structures of power that constitute our civilisation.
<br>(Heith for <span class="italic">musicmap</span> in 2022)
</span></span>

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span><span class="italic">I learned this technique while working in sound design — you can just like deep-fake words. You just take syllables and move them around and if you do it correctly, it sounds like that's how they were spoken. So between the chords and my voice being deep-faked constantly, there isn't actually literal meaning in the music. Especially in Chinese, which is a monosyllabic language. It's actually just gibberish. You cannot understand anything. With that, even when I play these songs out as gibberish, people still have visceral emotional reactions to it. That indicates to me that the music has effectively imprinted whatever moment of emotion I had when I made it.</span>

<span class="hidden-at-start"><span>The insight of James Hillman, a student of Carl Jung aids me. A glimmer of hope. There is this one interview that I kept compulsively sending to my friends two years ago while struggling with mental exhaustion, reaching the limits of my sanity. In it, he identifies the root issue plaguing contemporary (so-called) Western societies as a chronic, numbing detachment from the world and its captivating beauty. <span class="italic">The “cosmos” which was the world for the universe, was at the same time signifying an adornment. The cosmos was an adornment.</span> Hillman suggests that we can heal ourselves by reigniting our sense of aesthetics.

The simple flâneur is always in full possession of their individuality, whereas the individuality of the badaud disappears. It is absorbed by the outside world...which intoxicates them to the point where they forget themselves. Under the influence of the spectacle which presents itself to them, the badaud becomes an impersonal creature; they are no longer a human being, they are a part of the public, of the crowd.

<span class="hidden-at-start-mobile"><span><span class="italic">How can we bear the present?</span>asks Lisa Robertson in her book Anemones—A Simone Weil Project, thinking near Weil herself. At one point, she focuses on how reinhabiting the words that were misused or co–opted by the terrorizing powers can be an experience deeply valuable for resisting the flattening narratives. Simone Weil lived amid horror. In the 1940s she wrote: <span class="italic">The sole strength in the world is purity.</span> (<span class="italic">Petrement,</span> Simone Weil, p.16) Robertson chooses to give space for contemplation of Weil’s usage of the term. Weil, herself was Jewish and antifascist, and her choice to give great importance and value in her writings to the term purity (a theft enacted by Nazi propaganda of the time) can seem misplaced or troubling. But Robertson convinces us that it is a difficult relationship that unfolds multitudes that we should aim at. It underlines the relationship to language as contextual, including the histories of abuse, and heresy of resistance. It is a purity that is considered as opposition to force, purity is the opposite of force. <span class="italic"> Here the word purity pertains not to an essence or a putative origin, nor a coalitional focus or exclusivity, but to a quality of social relationship</span>—social mutual consent. It is a heresy because not many will take the time to understand the purpose of this employment. But this approach faces us with something exciting for me. It stands in opposition to neglect or erasure, it claims the reality in its fullness, offering this linguistic reinhabitation as a difficult fight against singularity and binaries. <span class="italic">It opens our ways of coexisting, and so our mentalities, if not always to hope, at least to a discernment that evades the market-driven flattening and squandering and of our intellectual and spiritual beings. Such discernment must underpin any lovingly committed living in the world, where the world is the inconceivable, irritating, stimulating many-ness that will persist nonetheless to the end, whether personal or global.</span>

<span class="hidden-at-start-mobile"><span><span class="italic">Consider how feminist artists have made use of complaint, or how feminist art can be complaint. The Guerrilla Girls, for instance, had an exhibition called Complaints Department, in which individuals and organizations were invited to post “about art, culture, politics, the environment, or any other issue they care about.” They also ran office hours where you could share your complaints “face to face.” You can turn what might be assumed to be a mundane administrative practice into an art project. The direction of travel goes both ways. Those who make complaints, who enter that department, the Complaint Department (though of course making formal complaints often means entering many departments), can turn what they do—it might seem tedious, it might seem dull, all those papers—into art. Or perhaps there is no turning involved; perhaps there is an art in the mundane, to the mundane.

<span class="hidden-at-start-mobile"><span>Alongside these movements, new forms of surveillance were adopted in Europe to ensure that pregnant women did not terminate their pregnancies. Women were required to register every pregnancy and were sentenced to death if their infants died after a concealed delivery. Statutes were passed to surveil unwed mothers, and even unmarried pregnant women “became” illegal. A new medical practice prevailed that prioritized the life of the foetus over that of the mother which led to women being prosecuted in large numbers and later executed for infanticide. Midwives were marginalized, and male doctors came to be seen as the true "givers of life.".

We have to do this in order to get our work done. I think one purpose of art is to get us out of those routines. When we hear music or poetry or stories, the world opens up again. We’re drawn in — or out — and the windows of our perception are cleansed, as William Blake said.

These shapes have been designed and crafted to be used as a computer font with the specific purpose of enabling the practice of data divination, meditation, and investigations of the unconscious. This is a tool for detaching our cognitive system from the relationship between language and object, and from the relationship that connects a sound to a specific meaning. A tool for detaching us from our anthropocentric vision of realities. It’s also an attempt to sabotage our common language and—along with it—the structures of power that constitute our civilisation.

You just take syllables and move them around and if you do it correctly, it sounds like that's how they were spoken. So between the chords and my voice being deep-faked constantly, there isn't actually literal meaning in the music. Especially in Chinese, which is a monosyllabic language. It's actually just gibberish. You cannot understand anything. With that, even when I play these songs out as gibberish, people still have visceral emotional reactions to it. That indicates to me that the music has effectively imprinted whatever moment of emotion I had when I made it.</span>

There is this one interview that I kept compulsively sending to my friends two years ago while struggling with mental exhaustion, reaching the limits of my sanity.
